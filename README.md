Another 1-year project, on the video you can see the buggy dev build, but these bugs are nothing too complicated to fix given free time and some red bulls :)

The player has to go through these checkpoints. They are exactly as wide as your character's mesh. You fail to do that - get sliced. 
Game gets progressively faster and faster until you eventually get cut up so much you start missing the checkpoints because of your thinness.
Your score at the top ends and you're done.
